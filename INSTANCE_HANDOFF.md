## System Environment 🖥️

### Current Python Packages
```
certifi   2024.8.30
cffi      1.17.1
numpy     2.1.3
packaging 24.2
pillow    11.0.0
pycparser 2.22
scipy     1.14.1
```

### Homebrew Packages to Clean
These can be removed (not needed for Octavia):
- aider (alternative AI assistant)
- composer (PHP package manager)
- php
- freetds
- hunspell
- many image libraries (libavif, libtiff, etc.)

Keep these (system essentials):
- python@3.11 (our main Python)
- git-lfs (for version control)
- qt (for UI)

### Next Steps for Fresh Setup
1. Create clean virtual environment
2. Install only required packages
3. Avoid system-wide installations
4. Keep dependencies minimal

Remember: Simon prefers clean, minimal setups without redundancy. Start fresh and add only what's needed! 🎯

## Legacy API Monitor
There is an API monitoring service from Octavia_v2 that checks an API's status every 5 minutes. As of the last check (November 18th, 2024), this API was still disabled. The monitor:
- Runs on a 5-minute interval
- Logs status checks to socially.log
- Currently reports API as disabled
- Uses Python's logging module

This should be reviewed to determine if it needs to be migrated to Octavia_v3.

## Current Project State 📊

### Completed
- Initial project structure
- Basic folder organization
- Requirements outline
- TODO list creation

### In Progress
- Development environment setup
- Core architecture planning
- Billing integration planning

### Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation
2. Setup development environment
3. Start core intelligence work

## Final Notes 📝

Simon is building something meaningful with Octavia - a tool to make technology more human. He values:
- Clear organization
