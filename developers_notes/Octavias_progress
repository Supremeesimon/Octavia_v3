## Agent Integration Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to integrate your agent with the Octavia AI platform.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

* An Octavia account
* An agent that meets the Octavia API requirements
* A development environment with Python 3.6 or later installed

### Integration Process

1. **Create an Octavia agent.** You can create an agent through the Octavia dashboard or via the API.
2. **Configure your agent.** Once you have created an agent, you will need to configure it with the necessary information. This includes the agent's name, description, and API key.
3. **Test your agent.** Once you have configured your agent, you can test it by sending it a request. You can use the Octavia dashboard or the API to send requests to your agent.
4. **Deploy your agent.** Once you have tested your agent and are satisfied with its performance, you can deploy it to the Octavia platform. You can deploy your agent through the Octavia dashboard or via the API.

### Additional Resources
