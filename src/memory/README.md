# Memory Layer 💭

Octavia's ability to learn and remember - making every interaction better than the last.

## Structure

### 📁 storage/
Persistent memory:
- User preferences
- System states
- Conversation history
- Configuration data

### 📁 learning/
Pattern recognition:
- User habits
- Common tasks
- Preferred solutions
- Interaction styles

### 📁 patterns/
Behavioral understanding:
- Work patterns
- Usage patterns
- Time patterns
- Task patterns

## How It Works

1. Every interaction teaches
2. Patterns emerge naturally
3. Preferences are remembered
4. Suggestions improve

Example:
```
User: "Time to work"
Octavia: "I remember you usually start with email and calendar.
         Want me to set those up while you grab coffee?" 
```

Learning that feels personal! 🌱
