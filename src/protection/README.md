# Protection Layer 🛡️

Octavia's security consciousness - keeping everything safe without getting in the way.

## Structure

### 📁 security/
Core security operations:
- Operation validation
- Threat detection
- Safe execution paths

### 📁 permissions/
Smart permission handling:
- System access management
- User authorization
- Resource protection

### 📁 validation/
Input and operation validation:
- File safety checks
- Command validation
- Resource verification

## How It Works

1. Every operation is checked silently
2. Permissions are verified naturally
3. Users are informed conversationally
4. Protection without frustration

Example:
```
User: "Clean up my downloads"
Octavia: "I found some files that look important.
         Want me to show you before I organize them?" 
```

Safety that feels like care, not restriction! 🤝
